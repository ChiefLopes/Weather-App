# React + Vite

This is a weather web that fetches and displays weather data from cities around the world.

This project was done with React+viite along with saas css. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Why this project
This project was created to blend up my skils in working with APIs.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
